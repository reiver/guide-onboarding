# GUIDE: onboarding

This guide tells you what to do when **onboarding** a new individual who is joining a team, a department, or a company.

----

There are some thing that need to happen _BEFORE_ the **new person** joins, and there are things that need to happen _AFTER_ the **new person** joins.

## Before They Join

There are some things that need to happen _BEFORE_ the **new person** joins:

* there are things that need to be **decided**, and
* there are **meetings** that need to be **scheduled**.

## Before They Join: Decisions

Here are some things that need to be **decided**:

1. Who is the **new person**'s **Supervisor**?

2. Who is the **new person**'s **Lead**?

Note that the **Supervisor** and **Lead** _could_ be the same person.
The **Supervisor** and **Lead** _could_ also be different people.
But on some teams these might be the same person.

3. Who will **train** the **new person**?

Note that there could be _more than_ once person involved in the **training** of the **new person**.
Although it could just be **one person** doing the training.
In most cases it would be a good idea for the **Lead** to be involved in the training.

Someone should decide all of these _BEFORE_ the **new person** joins.

## Before They Join: Meetings Scheduled

The **Lead** will need to schedule a bunch of one-time meetings for the **new person** with people already at the company (including themselves).

1. Meeting with **Lead**

2. Meeting with **Supervisor**

If the **Lead** & **Supervisor** are the same person, then there doesn't need to be two separate meetings.

3. Meeting with **senior manager №1**

It is good to know other people in the company.

4. Meeting with **senior manager №2**

Again, it is good to know other people in the company.

5. Meeting with **each member** of the **team**.

6. Meeting with **Lead** (again)

The order of these meetings matters.
The first meeting at the beginning of the day should start with their **Lead**.
And the last meeting at the end of their day should end with their **Lead**.

The **Lead** also has a special role.
The **Lead** will be who the **new person** can always get help from, ask questions of, etc, at any time during their term with the company.

## After They Join: Accounts

There are a number of the **new person** will need.

The **Lead** should arrange for the **new person** to get setup on each of these.

The **Lead** should also **train** the person on each of these.

1. a corporate e-mail account

Not everyone will have one of these.
But for people who do, we will need one set up for them.
And the **new person** will need to be **trained** on how to use it.

2. Discord

3. GitHub

## After They Join: Regular Meetings

There are a number of **regular meetings** that need to be **scheduled** for the **new hire**.

Some of these meetings are **completely new meetings**.
Some of these meetings are **existing meetings** that they will also join.

These meetings are:

1. Weekly 1-on-1 Meeting With Lead

2. Monthly 1-on-1 Meeting with Supervisor
