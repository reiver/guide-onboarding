# GUIDE: onboarding

This guide tells you what to do when **onboarding** a **new person** who is joining a team, a department, or a company.

At the bottom of this document is a check-list.

**You should use the check-list when a **new person** is being onboarded.**

But you need to read this whole document so you actually understand what is in the check-list.

Congratulations! — a **new person** is joining the company.

After a recruiting process, interviews, an offer being given, and an offer accepted, a **new person** is joining the company.

**What happens next?**

With some companies, the **new person** shows up, and they have to figure out things on their own.
A **new person** who goes through this might struggle for a year!

We don't want this problem.
We want to make the **new person** productive as quickly as possible.

Thus, this **guide** exists to give you instructions on a way to make the **new person** productive as quickly as possible.

----

There are some things that need to happen _BEFORE_ the **new person** joins, and there are things that need to happen _AFTER_ the **new person** joins.

## Before They Join

There are some things that need to happen _BEFORE_ the **new person** joins:

* there are things that need to be **decided**, and
* there are **meetings** that need to be **scheduled**.

## Before They Join: Decisions

Here are some things that need to be **decided**:

1. Who is the **new person**'s **Supervisor**?

2. Who is the **new person**'s **Lead**?

(Just to explicit about terms — such as **Supervisor** versus **Lead**. A **Supervisor** is concerned with things such as enforcing employee compliance — ex: don't slack off, do your job, show up to meetings, write this report, etc. A **Lead** is concerned with couching, pairing, being an example of what others should pay attention to, copy, and strive to replicate, etc.)

Note that the **Supervisor** and **Lead** _could_ be the same person.
The **Supervisor** and **Lead** _could_ also be different people.
But on some teams these might be the same person.

3. Who will **train** the **new person**?

Note that there could be _more than_ once person involved in the **training** of the **new person**.
Although it could just be **one person** doing the training.
In most cases it would be a good idea for the **Lead** to be involved in the training.

Someone should decide all of these _BEFORE_ the **new person** joins.

## Before They Join: Meetings Scheduled

The **Lead** will need to schedule a bunch of one-time meetings for the **new person** with people already at the company (including themselves).

1. Meeting with **Lead**

2. Meeting with **Supervisor**

If the **Lead** & **Supervisor** are the same person, then there doesn't need to be two separate meetings.

3. Meeting with **senior manager №1**

It is good to know other people in the company.

4. Meeting with **senior manager №2**

Again, it is good to know other people in the company.

5. Meeting with **each member** of the **team**.

6. Meeting with **Lead** (again)

The order of these meetings matters.
The first meeting at the beginning of the day should start with their **Lead**.
And the last meeting at the end of their day should end with their **Lead**.

The **Lead** also has a special role.
The **Lead** will be who the **new person** can always get help from, ask questions of, etc, at any time during their term with the company.

## After They Join

There are some things that need to happen AFTER the **new person** joins:

* there are things that need to be **set up** for them, 
* there are **regular meetings** that need to be **scheduled**,
* there is **training** that needs to happen, and
* there is **team integration** that needs to happen.

## After They Join: Accounts

There are a number of accounts the **new person** will need.

The **Lead** should arrange for the **new person** to get setup on each of these.

The **Lead** should also **train** the person on each of these.

1. a corporate e-mail account

Not everyone will have one of these.
But for people who do, we will need one set up for them.
And the **new person** will need to be **trained** on how to use it.

2. Discord

3. GitHub

## After They Join: Regular Meetings

There are a number of **regular meetings** that need to be **scheduled** for the **new hire**.

Some of these meetings are **completely new meetings**.
Some of these meetings are **existing meetings** that they will also join.

These meetings are:

1. Weekly 1-on-1 Meeting With **Lead**.

2. Monthly 1-on-1 Meeting with **Supervisor**.

3. Team Demo Meetings

These **team demo meetings** are at least 3 days a week, if not daily.
(Daily would be better.)

4. Other **Team meetings**.

Whatever those **team meetings** are, the **new person** needs to be invited to them, and understand what each of them are.
The **Lead** should explain what each of these meetings are about.

## After They Join: Training

What training the **new person** gets depends on the **role** or **roles** they are filling, and what **team** they are joining.

The **Lead** is responsible for making sure the **new person**'s **training** takes place at this point.
The **Lead** might even be doing the **training**.

But after all that, whomever is training them (and it is possible that could be more than one person) needs to give them whatever **training** is appropriate for the **role** or **roles** they are filling.

(For example, a back-end software developer would get one type of training; a UX designer would get a different type of training; a marketing director would get yet another type of training; etc.)

## After They Join: Integration Into Team

And once all that is done, they should be **integrated** into whatever **team** or **teams** they are joining.

I.e., they will actually start doing their job.

Their **Lead** will still be around to help them if they need it, of course.
